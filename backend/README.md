# Microservices Project

## Overview

This project is a collection of microservices built using Node.js and MongoDB. The services include:

- **User Service**: Manages user authentication and user profiles.
- **Task Service**: Handles tasks and their details.
- **Project Service**: Manages projects and their associated data.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.
- **Reporting Service**: Generates and manages reports.
- **Common Libraries**: Provides shared utilities, middlewares, and configuration files.

## Architecture

The microservices communicate with each other and share common functionality via the `common-libs` package. Each service is designed to be independently deployable and scalable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- MongoDB (you can use a local or remote instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd microservices-project
   ```

2. **Install Common Libraries**

   Navigate to the `common-libs` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd common-libs
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Each Microservice**

   Navigate to each service directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd user-service
   npm install

   cd ../task-service
   npm install

   cd ../project-service
   npm install

   cd ../notification-service
   npm install

   cd ../reporting-service
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Each service requires environment variables. Create a `.env` file in each service directory with the following example content:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/<service-name>
   PORT=3001
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `<service-name>` with the appropriate name for each service, e.g., `user-service`, `task-service`, etc.

5. **Build and Run with Docker (Optional)**

   Use Docker to build and run the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   Ensure you have `docker-compose.override.yml` files in place for configuring the services.

### Usage

#### User Service

- **Endpoint:** `/api/users`
- **Functionality:** User registration, login, and profile management.

**Sample API Call:**

- **Register a User**

  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpass"}'
  ```

#### Task Service

- **Endpoint:** `/api/tasks`
- **Functionality:** Manage tasks including creation and updates.

**Sample API Call:**

- **Create a Task**

  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "New Task", "description": "Task details", "userId": "user-1234"}'
  ```

#### Project Service

- **Endpoint:** `/api/projects`
- **Functionality:** Manage projects and their details.

**Sample API Call:**

- **Create a Project**

  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "New Project", "description": "Project details"}'
  ```

#### Notification Service

- **Endpoint:** `/api/notifications`
- **Functionality:** Send notifications to users.

**Sample API Call:**

- **Send a Notification**

  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "user-1234", "message": "You have a new notification!"}'
  ```

#### Reporting Service

- **Endpoint:** `/api/reports`
- **Functionality:** Generate and retrieve reports.

**Sample API Call:**

- **Generate a Report**

  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/reports/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectId": "project-1234", "title": "Annual Report", "content": "Report content"}'
  ```

### Common Libraries

- **Logger:** Provides logging functionality.
- **Auth Middleware:** Middleware for JWT authentication.
- **Database Configuration:** Common MongoDB connection setup.
- **Server Configuration:** Shared server configuration settings.

**Usage Example:**

```js
const { logger, authMiddleware, connectDB, serverConfig } = require('common-libs');

// Connect to the database
connectDB();

// Apply authentication middleware
app.use(authMiddleware);

// Start the server
app.listen(serverConfig.port, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${serverConfig.port}`);
});
```

## Testing

To test individual services:

```bash
cd user-service
npm test
```

Repeat for other services as needed.
